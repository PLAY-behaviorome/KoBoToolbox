## Purpose {-}

PLAY project researchers use [KoBoToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) to collect data from participant families.
Data from all sessions at all PLAY data collection sites are pushed to a common set of files on the KoBoToolbox server.

This document describes the process of i) downloading, ii) parsing, iii) cleaning, and iv) exporting these files into forms more suitable for data analysis.

## Overview of data sets {-}

There are two sets of data collected using KoBoToolbox.
One set is collected during the recruiting and screening calls for the study.
The second set is collected during the home visit.

### Data access and processing {-}

All data are downloaded and manipulated locally but are **not** synched to GitHub.
This is accomplished by adding `data` to [`protocol/.gitignore`](.gitignore).

There are separate processes for detecting and deleting personal identifiers from specific data files and exporting 'cleaned' versions that may be shared on Databrary.

### Home visit data {-}

There are three (3) age groups (12-, 18-, and 24-month-olds) and four (4) different language environment groups (English-only, Spanish-only, Bilingual-English-dominant, Bilingual-Spanish-dominant).
Since the language of the questions and some of the specific questions vary by age group and by language environment group, there are $3*4=12$ different KoBoToolbox survey form files that must be processed.
