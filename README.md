# KoBoToolbox
Code to process survey data collected via KoBoToolbox.

## Overview

PLAY project researchers use [KoBoToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) to collect data from participant families.
Data from all sessions at all PLAY data collection sites is pushed to a common set of files on the KoBoToolbox server.
We need to i) download, ii) parse, iii) clean, and iv) export these files into forms more suitable for data analysis.

## Workflows

- [Working document](gather-clean.html) to develop and test import, cleaning, and export procedures.
