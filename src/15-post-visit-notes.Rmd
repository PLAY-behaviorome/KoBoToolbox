# Post-visit notes {-}

## Select forms from KBT {-}

The post-visit notes are stored in a separate KBT form with "Post-Visit" in the title.

```
tar_target(kb_post_visit, dplyr::filter(
    kb_df, stringr::str_detect(title, "Post\\-Visit")
  ))
```

## Download forms as XLSX {-}

A special function `make_post_visit_df()` downloads the XLSX forms, converts them to CSVs, 
saves the CSVs in a specific directory, and then selects one of them--the most recent form--to open as a data frame.

There is a smaller, older post-visit data file with fewer fields that can be reconciled with the current active one at a later date.

```
tar_target(
    post_visit_df,
    make_post_visit_df(kb_post_visit,
                       "data/xlsx/post_visit",
                       "data/csv/post_visit")
  ),
```
