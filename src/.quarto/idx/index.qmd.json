collect data from participant families.\nData from all sessions at all PLAY data collection sites are pushed to a common set of files on the KoBoToolbox server.\n\nThis document describes the process

calls for the study.\nThis is called the screening or demographic data.\n\nThe second set is collected during the home visit.\nThis is called the home visit data.\n\nThe third set consists of notes generated by the experimenter after the visit.\nThis data is called the post-visit data.\n\n### Data access and processing {-}\n\nAll data are downloaded and manipulated locally but are **not** synched to GitHub.\nThis is accomplished by adding `data` to [`.gitignore`](.gitignore).\n\nThere are separate processes for detecting and deleting personal identifiers from specific data files and exporting 'cleaned' versions that may be shared on Databrary.\n\n### Home visit data {-}\n\nThere are three (3) age groups (12-, 18-, and 24-month-olds) and four (4) different language environment groups (English-only, Spanish-only, Bilingual-English-dominant, Bilingual-Spanish-dominant).\nSince the language of the questions and some of the specific questions vary by age group and by language environment group, there multiple KoBoToolbox survey form files that must be processed.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,\n
