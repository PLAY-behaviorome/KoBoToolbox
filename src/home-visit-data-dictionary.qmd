# Home visit: Data dictionary

::: {.callout-note}
This data dictionary workflow does _not_ include the questions that were
asked.
Adding that, and more descriptive information, is a high priority.
:::

The home visit data are generated by a specific target.
We load it here to give us the latest data.

```{r}
if (!('home_visit_df' %in% ls())) {
  targets::tar_load(home_visit_df, store="../_targets")
}
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
hv_dd <- datadictionary::create_dictionary(home_visit_df)

readr::write_csv(hv_dd, paste0(here::here(), "/data/csv/home_visit/dd/PLAY-home-visit-data-dictionary.csv"))
```

Here is a preliminary data dictionary provides:

```{r}
hv_dd |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_classic()
```
