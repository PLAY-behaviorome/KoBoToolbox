    "text": "Overview of data sets\nThere are three sets of data collected using KoBoToolbox.\nOne set is collected during the recruiting and screening calls for the study. This is called the screening or demographic data.\nThe second set is collected during the home visit. This is called the home visit data.\nThe third set consists of notes generated by the experimenter after the visit. This data is called the post-visit data.\n\nData access and processing\nAll data are downloaded and manipulated locally but are not synched to GitHub. This is accomplished by adding data to .gitignore.\nThere are separate processes for detecting and deleting personal identifiers from specific data files and exporting ‘cleaned’ versions that may be shared on Databrary.\n\n\nHome visit data\nThere are three (3) age groups (12-, 18-, and 24-month-olds) and four (4) different language environment groups (English-only, Spanish-only, Bilingual-English-dominant, Bilingual-Spanish-dominant). Since the language of the questions and some of the specific questions vary by age group and by language environment group, there multiple KoBoToolbox survey form files that must be processed.",

Here is the target for that process:\n# Not evaluated\n  tar_target(\n    kb_screen_df,\n    kobo_list_data_filtered(\"[Dd]emographic\"),\n    cue = tarchetypes::tar_cue_age(\n      name = kb_screen,\n      age = as.difftime(update_interval, units = update_interval_units)\n    )\n  ),\nThen we download and save the raw XLSX files to ../data/xlsx/screening using kobo_retrieve_save_many_xlsx(kb_screen_df, save_dir = \"../data/xlsx/screening\"). Finally, we convert the XLSX files to CSVs via file_load_xlsx_save_many_csv(\"../data/xlsx/screening\", \"../data/csv/screening\", \"Demographic\"). The latter two steps are handled by the wrapper function screen_download_convert(kb_screen_df, \"data/xlsx/screening\", \"data/csv/screening\"). Here is the accompanying target:\n# Download screening/demographic survey\n  tar_target(\n    screen_download,\n    screen_download_convert(kb_screen_df, \"data/xlsx/screening\", \"data/csv/screening\"),\n    cue = tarchetypes::tar_cue_age(\n      name = screen_df,\n      age = as.difftime(update_interval, units = update_interval_units)\n    )\n  ),\nWe can confirm that these functions have run properly, as follows:\n\nscreening_fl &lt;- list.files(\"../data/csv/screening/\", pattern = \"*.csv$\")\n\n\n\nSurvey questions\nThere are n=3 screening/demographic data files.\nThe KoBoToolbox API enables us to download a table with the questions, as follows.\n\ntargets::tar_load(kb_screen_df, store=\"../_targets\")\nkb_screen_df\n\n      id              id_string                                    title\n1 334134 agChfbnGHc6fiUdfYUaZ2z PLAY Demographic Questionnaire (Spanish)\n2 359546 aGLEqT7eRBhuPgizCQBeqA           PLAY Demographic Questionnaire\n3 275882 anqhvxKtQieo7gc9uPqJ3y           PLAY Demographic Questionnaire\n                               description\n1 PLAY Demographic Questionnaire (Spanish)\n2            New Demographic Questionnaire\n3                 PLAY Phone Questionnaire\n                                            url\n1 https://kc.kobotoolbox.org/api/v1/data/334134\n2 https://kc.kobotoolbox.org/api/v1/data/359546\n3 https://kc.kobotoolbox.org/api/v1/data/275882\n                                                             form_url\n1 https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/api/v2/assets/agChfbnGHc6fiUdfYUaZ2z.xls\n2 https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/api/v2/assets/aGLEqT7eRBhuPgizCQBeqA.xls\n3 https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/api/v2/assets/anqhvxKtQieo7gc9uPqJ3y.xls\n\n\nBased on this information, we know that the questionnaires may be downloaded from the following URLs:\n\npaste0(\"https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/api/v2/assets/\", kb_screen_df$id_string, \".xls\")\n\n[1] \"https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/api/v2/assets/agChfbnGHc6fiUdfYUaZ2z.xls\"\n[2] \"https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/api/v2/assets/aGLEqT7eRBhuPgizCQBeqA.xls\"\n[3] \"https://kf.kobotoolbox.org/api/v2/assets/anqhvxKtQieo7gc9uPqJ3y.xls\"\n\n\nWe import and clean the screening/demographic data in the next section.",
